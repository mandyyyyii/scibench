    "problem_text": "Figure 23-46a shows three plastic sheets that are large, parallel, and uniformly charged. Figure 23-46b gives the component of the net electric field along an $x$ axis through the sheets. The scale of the vertical axis is set by $E_s=6.0 \\times 10^5 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{C}$. What is the ratio of the charge density on sheet 3 to that on sheet 2 ?",
