    "problem_text": " The square surface shown in Fig. 23-30 measures $3.2 \\mathrm{~mm}$ on each side. It is immersed in a uniform electric field with magnitude $E=1800 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{C}$ and with field lines at an angle of $\\theta=35^{\\circ}$ with a normal to the surface, as shown. Take that normal to be directed \"outward,\" as though the surface were one face of a box. Calculate the electric flux through the surface.",
