    "problem_text": "In crystals of the salt cesium chloride, cesium ions $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$form the eight corners of a cube and a chlorine ion $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is at the cube's center (Fig. 21-36). The edge length of the cube is $0.40 \\mathrm{~nm}$. The $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$ions are each deficient by one electron (and thus each has a charge of $+e$ ), and the $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion has one excess electron (and thus has a charge of $-e$ ). What is the magnitude of the net electrostatic force exerted on the $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion by the eight $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$ions at the corners of the cube?",
