    "problem_text": "Figure 22-52a shows a nonconducting rod with a uniformly distributed charge $+Q$. The rod forms a half-circle with radius $R$ and produces an electric field of magnitude $E_{\\mathrm{arc}}$ at its center of curvature $P$. If the arc is collapsed to a point at distance $R$ from $P$ (Fig. 22-52b), by what factor is the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ multiplied?",
