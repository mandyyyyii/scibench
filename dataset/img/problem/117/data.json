    "problem_text": " In Fig. 22-64a, a particle of charge $+Q$ produces an electric field of magnitude $E_{\\text {part }}$ at point $P$, at distance $R$ from the particle. In Fig. 22-64b, that same amount of charge is spread uniformly along a circular arc that has radius $R$ and subtends an angle $\\theta$. The charge on the arc produces an electric field of magnitude $E_{\\mathrm{arc}}$ at its center of curvature $P$. For what value of $\\theta$ does $E_{\\text {arc }}=$ $0.500 E_{\\text {part }}$ ? (Hint: You will probably resort to a graphical solution.)",
