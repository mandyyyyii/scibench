    "problem_text": " In Fig. 21-32, particles 1 and 2 of charge $q_1=q_2=+3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ are on a $y$ axis at distance $d=17.0 \\mathrm{~cm}$ from the origin. Particle 3 of charge $q_3=+6.40 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ is moved gradually along the $x$ axis from $x=0$ to $x=$ $+5.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. At what values of $x$ will the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the third particle from the other two particles be minimum?\r\n",
