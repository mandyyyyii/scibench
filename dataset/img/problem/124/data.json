{"problem_text": "This problem is quite challenging in setting up but takes only a few lines of algebra to solve. We deal with not only uniformly circular motion but also a ramp. However, we will not need a tilted coordinate system as with other ramps. Instead we can take a freeze-frame of the motion and work with simply horizontal and vertical axes. As always in this chapter, the starting point will be to apply Newton's second law, but that will require us to identify the force component that is responsible for the uniform circular motion.\r\n\r\nCurved portions of highways are always banked (tilted) to prevent cars from sliding off the highway. When a highway is dry, the frictional force between the tires and the road surface may be enough to prevent sliding. When the highway is wet, however, the frictional force may be negligible, and banking is then essential. Figure  represents a car of mass $m$ as it moves at a constant speed $v$ of $20 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ around a banked circular track of radius $R=190 \\mathrm{~m}$. (It is a normal car, rather than a race car, which means that any vertical force from the passing air is negligible.) If the frictional force from the track is negligible, what bank angle $\\theta$ prevents sliding?", "answer_latex": " 12", "answer_number": "12", "unit": " $^{\\circ}$", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 6.06", "comment": " "}
