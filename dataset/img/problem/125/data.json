{"problem_text": "Figure shows a water-slide ride in which a glider is shot by a spring along a water-drenched (frictionless) track that takes the glider from a horizontal section down to ground level. As the glider then moves along ground-level track, it is gradually brought to rest by friction. The total mass of the glider and its rider is $m=200 \\mathrm{~kg}$, the initial compression of the spring is $d=5.00 \\mathrm{~m}$, the spring constant is $k=3.20 \\times$ $10^3 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$, the initial height is $h=35.0 \\mathrm{~m}$, and the coefficient of kinetic friction along the ground-level track is $\\mu_k=0.800$. Through what distance $L$ does the glider slide along the ground-level track until it stops?", "answer_latex": " 69.3", "answer_number": "69.3", "unit": " m", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 8.06", "comment": " "}
