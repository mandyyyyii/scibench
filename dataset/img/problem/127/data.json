{"problem_text": "The main lesson of this sample problem is this: It is perfectly all right to choose an easy path instead of a hard path. Figure shows a $2.0 \\mathrm{~kg}$ block of slippery cheese that slides along a frictionless track from point $a$ to point $b$. The cheese travels through a total distance of $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$ along the track, and a net vertical distance of $0.80 \\mathrm{~m}$. How much work is done on the cheese by the gravitational force during the slide?", "answer_latex": " 15.7", "answer_number": "15.7", "unit": " J", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 8.01 ", "comment": " "}
