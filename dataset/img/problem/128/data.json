{"problem_text": "In Figure, a cockroach with mass $m$ rides on a disk of mass $6.00 \\mathrm{~m}$ and radius $R$. The disk rotates like a merry-go-round around its central axis at angular speed $\\omega_i=1.50 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. The cockroach is initially at radius $r=0.800 R$, but then it crawls out to the rim of the disk. Treat the cockroach as a particle. What then is the angular speed?", "answer_latex": "1.37", "answer_number": "1.37", "unit": " rad/s", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 11.06", "comment": " "}
