{"problem_text": "This sample problem involves a tilted applied force, which requires that we work with components to find a frictional force. The main challenge is to sort out all the components. Figure shows a force of magnitude $F=$ $12.0 \\mathrm{~N}$ applied to an $8.00 \\mathrm{~kg}$ block at a downward angle of $\\theta=30.0^{\\circ}$. The coefficient of static friction between block and floor is $\\mu_s=0.700$; the coefficient of kinetic friction is $\\mu_k=0.400$. What is the magnitude of the frictional force on the block?", "answer_latex": " 10.39", "answer_number": "10.39", "unit": " N", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 6.01", "comment": " "}
