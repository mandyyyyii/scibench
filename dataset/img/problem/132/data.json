{"problem_text": "Here is an example of a common technique in physics. We have a demonstration that cannot be worked out as a whole (we don't have a workable equation for it). So, we break it up into steps that can be worked separately (we have equations for them).\r\n\r\nThe ballistic pendulum was used to measure the speeds of bullets before electronic timing devices were developed. The version shown in Figure consists of a large block of wood of mass $M=5.4 \\mathrm{~kg}$, hanging from two long cords. A bullet of mass $m=9.5 \\mathrm{~g}$ is fired into the block, coming quickly to rest. The block + bullet then swing upward, their center of mass rising a vertical distance $h=6.3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ before the pendulum comes momentarily to rest at the end of its arc. What is the speed of the bullet just prior to the collision?", "answer_latex": " 630", "answer_number": "630", "unit": " m/s", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 9.07", "comment": " "}
