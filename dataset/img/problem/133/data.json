{"problem_text": "In Fig. 4-20a, a plane moves due east while the pilot points the plane somewhat south of east, toward a steady wind that blows to the northeast. The plane has velocity $\\vec{v}_{P W}$ relative to the wind, with an airspeed (speed relative to the wind) of $215 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$, directed at angle $\\theta$ south of east. The wind has velocity $\\vec{v}_{W G}$ relative to the ground with speed $65.0 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$, directed $20.0^{\\circ}$ east of north. What is the magnitude of the velocity $\\vec{v}_{P G}$ of the plane relative to the ground?", "answer_latex": " 228", "answer_number": " 228", "unit": "km/h", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 4.08", "comment": " "}
