{"problem_text": "Some of the funniest videos on the web involve motorists sliding uncontrollably on icy roads. Here let's compare the typical stopping distances for a car sliding to a stop from an initial speed of $10.0 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ on a dry horizontal road, an icy horizontal road, and (everyone's favorite) an icy hill.\r\nHow far does the car take to slide to a stop on a horizontal road (Figure) if the coefficient of kinetic friction is $\\mu_k=0.60$, which is typical of regular tires on dry pavement? Let's neglect any effect of the air on the car, assume that the wheels lock up and the tires slide, and extend an $x$ axis in the car's direction of motion.", "answer_latex": " 8.50", "answer_number": " 8.50", "unit": " m", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 6.02", "comment": " "}
