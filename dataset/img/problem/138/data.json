{"problem_text": "Phenylalanine (Phe, 5) is a naturally occurring amino acid. What is the energy of interaction between its phenyl group and the electric dipole moment of a neighbouring peptide group? Take the distance between the groups as $4.0 \\mathrm{~nm}$ and treat the phenyl group as a benzene molecule. The magnitude of the dipole moment of the peptide group is $\\mu=1.3 \\mathrm{D}$ and the polarizability volume of benzene is $\\alpha^{\\prime}=1.04 \\times 10^{-29} \\mathrm{~m}^3$.\r\n", "answer_latex": " -4.3", "answer_number": "-4.3", "unit": "$10^{-28} \\mathrm{~J}$", "source": "matter", "problemid": " 35.1", "comment": " problem"}
