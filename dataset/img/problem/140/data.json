{"problem_text": "One of the most dramatic videos on the web (but entirely fictitious) supposedly shows a man sliding along a long water slide and then being launched into the air to land in a water pool. Let's attach some reasonable numbers to such a flight to calculate the velocity with which the man would have hit the water. Figure indicates the launch and landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate system with its origin conveniently located at the launch site. From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as $D=20.0 \\mathrm{~m}$, the flight time as $t=2.50 \\mathrm{~s}$, and the launch angle as $\\theta_0=40.0^{\\circ}$. Find the magnitude of the velocity at launch and at landing.", "answer_latex": "10.44", "answer_number": "10.44", "unit": " m/s", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 4.05", "comment": " "}
