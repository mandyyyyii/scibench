{"problem_text": "Figure is an overhead view of the path taken by a race car driver as his car collides with the racetrack wall. Just before the collision, he is traveling at speed $v_i=70 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ along a straight line at $30^{\\circ}$ from the wall. Just after the collision, he is traveling at speed $v_f=50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ along a straight line at $10^{\\circ}$ from the wall. His mass $m$ is $80 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The collision lasts for $14 \\mathrm{~ms}$. What is the magnitude of the average force on the driver during the collision?", "answer_latex": " 2.583", "answer_number": "2.583", "unit": " $10^5$ N", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 9.04", "comment": " "}
