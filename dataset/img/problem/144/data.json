{"problem_text": "A raindrop with radius $R=1.5 \\mathrm{~mm}$ falls from a cloud that is at height $h=1200 \\mathrm{~m}$ above the ground. The drag coefficient $C$ for the drop is 0.60 . Assume that the drop is spherical throughout its fall. The density of water $\\rho_w$ is $1000 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3$, and the density of air $\\rho_a$ is $1.2 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3$.\r\nAs the Table indicates, the raindrop reaches terminal speed after falling just a few meters. What is the terminal speed?", "answer_latex": "7.4", "answer_number": "7.4", "unit": " m/s", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 6.03", "comment": " "}
