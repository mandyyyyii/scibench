{"problem_text": "A modern race car is designed so that the passing air pushes down on it, allowing the car to travel much faster through a flat turn in a Grand Prix without friction failing. This downward push is called negative lift. Can a race car have so much negative lift that it could be driven upside down on a long ceiling, as done fictionally by a sedan in the first Men in Black movie?\r\n\r\nFigure represents a Grand Prix race car of mass $m=600 \\mathrm{~kg}$ as it travels on a flat track in a circular arc of radius $R=100 \\mathrm{~m}$. Because of the shape of the car and the wings on it, the passing air exerts a negative lift $\\vec{F}_L$ downward on the car. The coefficient of static friction between the tires and the track is 0.75 . (Assume that the forces on the four tires are identical.)\r\nIf the car is on the verge of sliding out of the turn when its speed is $28.6 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, what is the magnitude of the negative lift $\\vec{F}_L$ acting downward on the car?", "answer_latex": " 663.7 ", "answer_number": " 663.7 ", "unit": " N", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 6.05", "comment": " "}
