{"problem_text": "Figure shows a block $S$ (the sliding block) with mass $M=3.3 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The block is free to move along a horizontal frictionless surface and connected, by a cord that wraps over a frictionless pulley, to a second block $H$ (the hanging block), with mass $m=2.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The cord and pulley have negligible masses compared to the blocks (they are \"massless\"). The hanging block $H$ falls as the sliding block $S$ accelerates to the right. Find the tension in the cord.", "answer_latex": " 13", "answer_number": "13", "unit": " N", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 5.03", "comment": " "}
