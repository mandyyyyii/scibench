    "problem_text": "A light is to be placed atop a pole of height $h$ feet to illuminate a busy traffic circle, which has a radius of $40 \\mathrm{ft}$. The intensity of illumination $I$ at any point $P$ on the circle is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ (see the figure) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $d$ from the source. How tall should the light pole be to maximize $I$?",
