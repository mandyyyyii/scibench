    "problem_text": "Figure 23-42 is a section of a conducting rod of radius $R_1=1.30 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and length $L=$ $11.00 \\mathrm{~m}$ inside a thin-walled coaxial conducting cylindrical shell of radius $R_2=10.0 R_1$ and the (same) length $L$. The net charge on the rod is $Q_1=+3.40 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{C}$; that on the shell is $Q_2=-2.00 Q_1$. What is the magnitude $E$ of the electric field at radial distance $r=2.00 R_2$?",
