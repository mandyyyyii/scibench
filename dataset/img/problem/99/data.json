    "problem_text": "In Fig. 22-51, two curved plastic rods, one of charge $+q$ and the other of charge $-q$, form a circle of radius $R=$ $8.50 \\mathrm{~cm}$ in an $x y$ plane. The $x$ axis passes through both of the connecting points, and the charge is distributed uniformly on both rods. If $q=15.0 \\mathrm{pC}$, what is the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ produced at $P$, the center of the circle?",
