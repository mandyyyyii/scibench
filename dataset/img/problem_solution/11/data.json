    "problem_text": "The region $\\mathscr{R}$ enclosed by the curves $y=x$ and $y=x^2$ is rotated about the $x$-axis. Find the volume of the resulting solid.",
    "solution": "The curves $y=x$ and $y=x^2$ intersect at the points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$. The region between them, the solid of rotation, and a cross-section perpendicular to the $x$-axis are shown in Figure 8 . A cross-section in the plane $P_x$ has the shape of a washer (an annular ring) with inner radius $x^2$ and outer radius $x$, so we find the cross-sectional area by subtracting the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle:\r\n$$\r\nA(x)=\\pi x^2-\\pi\\left(x^2\\right)^2=\\pi\\left(x^2-x^4\\right)\r\n$$\r\n\r\nTherefore we have\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nV & =\\int_0^1 A(x) d x=\\int_0^1 \\pi\\left(x^2-x^4\\right) d x \\\\\r\n& =\\pi\\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}-\\frac{x^5}{5}\\right]_0^1=\\frac{2 \\pi}{15}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$",
