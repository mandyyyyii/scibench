    "problem_text": "Guess the value of $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.",
    "solution": "The function $f(x)=(\\sin x) / x$ is not defined when $x=0$. Using a calculator (and remembering that, if $x \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\sin x$ means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is $x$ ), we construct a table of values correct to eight decimal places. From the table at the left and the graph in Figure 6 we guess that\r\n$$\r\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}=1\r\n$$\r\n\r\nThis guess is in fact correct, as will be proved in Chapter 3 using a geometric argument.",
