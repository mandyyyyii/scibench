{"problem_text": "If the particles in a system all move together, the com moves with them-no trouble there. But what happens when they move in different directions with different accelerations? Here is an example.\r\n\r\nThe three particles in Figure are initially at rest. Each experiences an external force due to bodies outside the three-particle system. The directions are indicated, and the magnitudes are $F_1=6.0 \\mathrm{~N}, F_2=12 \\mathrm{~N}$, and $F_3=14 \\mathrm{~N}$. What is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system?", "answer_latex": " 1.16", "answer_number": " 1.16", "unit": " $m/s^2$", "source": "fund", "problemid": " 9.03", "comment": " ", "solution": "The position of the center of mass is marked by a dot in the figure. We can treat the center of mass as if it were a real particle, with a mass equal to the system's total mass $M=16 \\mathrm{~kg}$. We can also treat the three external forces as if they act at the center of mass (Fig. 9-7b).\n\nCalculations: We can now apply Newton's second law $\\left(\\vec{F}_{\\text {net }}=m \\vec{a}\\right)$ to the center of mass, writing\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{\\text {net }}=M \\vec{a}_{\\mathrm{com}}\n$$\nor\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\vec{F}_1+\\vec{F}_2+\\vec{F}_3=M \\vec{a}_{\\mathrm{com}} \\\\\n& \\vec{a}_{\\mathrm{com}}=\\frac{\\vec{F}_1+\\vec{F}_2+\\vec{F}_3}{M} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nEquation 9-20 tells us that the acceleration $\\vec{a}_{\\text {com }}$ of the center of mass is in the same direction as the net external force $\\vec{F}_{\\text {net }}$ on the system (Fig. 9-7b). Because the particles are initially at rest, the center of mass must also be at rest. As the center of mass then begins to accelerate, it must move off in the common direction of $\\vec{a}_{\\text {com }}$ and $\\vec{F}_{\\text {net }}$.\n\nWe can evaluate the right side of Eq. 9-21 directly on a vector-capable calculator, or we can rewrite Eq. 9-21 in component form, find the components of $\\vec{a}_{\\text {com }}$, and then find $\\vec{a}_{\\text {com }}$. Along the $x$ axis, we have\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{\\mathrm{com}, x} & =\\frac{F_{1 x}+F_{2 x}+F_{3 x}}{M} \\\\\n& =\\frac{-6.0 \\mathrm{~N}+(12 \\mathrm{~N}) \\cos 45^{\\circ}+14 \\mathrm{~N}}{16 \\mathrm{~kg}}=1.03 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nAlong the $y$ axis, we have\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{\\mathrm{com}, y} & =\\frac{F_{1 y}+F_{2 y}+F_{3 y}}{M} \\\\\n& =\\frac{0+(12 \\mathrm{~N}) \\sin 45^{\\circ}+0}{16 \\mathrm{~kg}}=0.530 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nFrom these components, we find that $\\vec{a}_{\\mathrm{com}}$ has the magnitude\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{\\mathrm{com}} & =\\sqrt{\\left(a_{\\mathrm{com}, x}\\right)^2+\\left(a_{\\text {com }, y}\\right)^2} \\\\\n& =1.16 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n"}
