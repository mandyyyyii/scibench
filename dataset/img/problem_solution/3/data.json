    "problem_text": "A farmer has $2400 \\mathrm{ft}$ of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What is the smaller dimension of the field that has the largest area?",
    "solution": "In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let's experiment with some special cases. Figure I (not to scale) shows three possible ways of laying out the $2400 \\mathrm{ft}$ of fencing.\r\nArea $=700 \\cdot 1000=700,000 \\mathrm{ft}^2$\r\nArea $=1000 \\cdot 400=400,000 \\mathrm{ft}^2$\r\nWe see that when we try shallow, wide fields or deep, narrow fields, we get relatively small areas. It seems plausible that there is some intermediate configuration that produces the largest area.\r\nFigure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area $A$ of the rectangle. Let $x$ and $y$ be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express $A$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ :\r\n$$\r\nA=x y\r\n$$\r\n\r\nWe want to express $A$ as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate $y$ by expressing it in terms of $x$. To do this we use the given information that the total length of the fencing is $2400 \\mathrm{ft}$. Thus\r\n$$\r\n2 x+y=2400\r\n$$\r\n\r\nFrom this equation we have $y=2400-2 x$, which gives\r\n$$\r\nA=x(2400-2 x)=2400 x-2 x^2\r\n$$\r\n\r\nNote that $x \\geqslant 0$ and $x \\leqslant 1200$ (otherwise $A<0$ ). So the function that we wish to maximize is\r\n$$\r\nA(x)=2400 x-2 x^2 \\quad 0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant 1200\r\n$$\r\n\r\nThe derivative is $A^{\\prime}(x)=2400-4 x$, so to find the critical numbers we solve the equation\r\n$$\r\n2400-4 x=0\r\n$$\r\nwhich gives $x=600$. The maximum value of $A$ must occur either at this critical number or at an endpoint of the interval. Since $A(0)=0, A(600)=720,000$, and $A(1200)=0$, the Closed Interval Method gives the maximum value as $A(600)=720,000$.\r\n[Alternatively, we could have observed that $A^{\\prime \\prime}(x)=-4<0$ for all $x$, so $A$ is always concave downward and the local maximum at $x=600$ must be an absolute maximum.] Thus the rectangular field should be $600 \\mathrm{ft}$ deep and $1200 \\mathrm{ft}$ wide.",
