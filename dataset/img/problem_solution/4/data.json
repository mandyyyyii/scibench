    "problem_text": " A cylindrical can is to be made to hold $1 \\mathrm{~L}$ of oil. Find the radius that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.",
    "solution": "Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ the height (both in centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the total surface area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that the sides are made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions $2 \\pi r$ and $h$. So the surface area is\r\n$$\r\nA=2 \\pi r^2+2 \\pi r h\r\n$$\r\n\r\nTo eliminate $h$ we use the fact that the volume is given as $1 \\mathrm{~L}$, which we take to be $1000 \\mathrm{~cm}^3$. Thus\r\n$$\r\n\\pi r^2 h=1000\r\n$$\r\nwhich gives $h=1000 /\\left(\\pi r^2\\right)$. Substitution of this into the expression for $A$ gives\r\n$$\r\nA=2 \\pi r^2+2 \\pi r\\left(\\frac{1000}{\\pi r^2}\\right)=2 \\pi r^2+\\frac{2000}{r}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nTherefore the function that we want to minimize is\r\n$$\r\nA(r)=2 \\pi r^2+\\frac{2000}{r} \\quad r>0\r\n$$\r\n\r\nTo find the critical numbers, we differentiate:\r\n$$\r\nA(r)=4 \\pi r-\\frac{2000}{r^2}=\\frac{4\\left(\\pi r^3-500\\right)}{r^2}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nThen $A^{\\prime}(r)=0$ when $\\pi r^3=500$, so the only critical number is $r=\\sqrt[3]{500 / \\pi}$.\r\nSince the domain of $A$ is $(0, \\infty)$, we can't use the argument of Example 1 concerning endpoints. But we can observe that $A^{\\prime}(r)<0$ for $r<\\sqrt[3]{500 / \\pi}$ and $A^{\\prime}(r)>0$ for $r>\\sqrt[3]{500 / \\pi}$, so $A$ is decreasing for all $r$ to the left of the critical number and increasing for all $r$ to the right. Thus $r=\\sqrt[3]{500 / \\pi}$ must give rise to an absolute minimum.\r\n[Alternatively, we could argue that $A(r) \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$and $A(r) \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $r \\rightarrow \\infty$, so there must be a minimum value of $A(r)$, which must occur at the critical number. See Figure 5.]\r\n\r\nThe value of $h$ corresponding to $r=\\sqrt[3]{500 / \\pi}$ is\r\n$$\r\nh=\\frac{1000}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{1000}{\\pi(500 / \\pi)^{2 / 3}}=2 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{500}{\\pi}}=2 r\r\n$$\r\n\r\nThus, to minimize the cost of the can, the radius should be $\\sqrt[3]{500 / \\pi} \\mathrm{cm}$ and the height should be equal to twice the radius, namely, the diameter.",
